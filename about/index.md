Hi! I am iOS developer working in Kazan, Russia.

For last 6+ years, I am focused on iOS development. I pushed around 15-20 apps to App Store and built a couple of OS X apps. I am active Git user and open source contributor, keeping up-to-date with community.

Feel free to reach me by [email](mailto:evgeny@aleksandrov.ws) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/ealeksandrov).
